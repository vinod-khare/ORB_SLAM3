# ORB-SLAM3

### V1.0, December 22th, 2021
**Authors:** Carlos Campos, Richard Elvira, Juan J. Gómez Rodríguez, [José M. M. Montiel](http://webdiis.unizar.es/~josemari/), [Juan D. Tardos](http://webdiis.unizar.es/~jdtardos/).

The [Changelog](https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3/blob/master/Changelog.md) describes the features of each version.

ORB-SLAM3 is the first real-time SLAM library able to perform **Visual, Visual-Inertial and Multi-Map SLAM** with **monocular, stereo and RGB-D** cameras, using **pin-hole and fisheye** lens models. In all sensor configurations, ORB-SLAM3 is as robust as the best systems available in the literature, and significantly more accurate. 

This repository also includes a folder-based dataset runner. See the [ORB-SLAM3 app user guide](orbslam3_app/README.md) for build, input, and usage instructions and a list of the app's current features.

We provide examples to run ORB-SLAM3 in the [EuRoC dataset](http://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets) using stereo or monocular, with or without IMU, and in the [TUM-VI dataset](https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/visual-inertial-dataset) using fisheye stereo or monocular, with or without IMU. Videos of some example executions can be found at [ORB-SLAM3 channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXVt-kXG6T95Z4tVaYlU80Q).

This software is based on [ORB-SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2) developed by [Raul Mur-Artal](http://webdiis.unizar.es/~raulmur/), [Juan D. Tardos](http://webdiis.unizar.es/~jdtardos/), [J. M. M. Montiel](http://webdiis.unizar.es/~josemari/) and [Dorian Galvez-Lopez](http://doriangalvez.com/) ([DBoW2](https://github.com/dorian3d/DBoW2)).

# 2. Prerequisites
We have tested the library in **Ubuntu 16.04** and **18.04**, but it should be easy to compile in other platforms. A powerful computer (e.g. i7) will ensure real-time performance and provide more stable and accurate results.

## C++26 Compiler
Building the project requires a C++26-capable compiler and CMake 3.25 or newer.

## ImGui and VTK
The app uses Dear ImGui through Hello ImGui (GLFW/OpenGL3 backend) for a single window with resizable, dockable map and camera panes. VTK renders the map off-screen; OpenCV camera images and keypoint overlays are uploaded as ImGui textures. Install `hello-imgui[glfw-binding,opengl3-binding]` and `vtk` through vcpkg. Pangolin is no longer required. The core `ORB_SLAM3` library remains independent of UI libraries.

## OpenCV
We use [OpenCV](http://opencv.org) to manipulate images and features. Dowload and install instructions can be found at: http://opencv.org. **Required at leat 3.0. Tested with OpenCV 3.2.0 and 4.4.0**.

## Eigen3
Required by g2o (see below). Download and install instructions can be found at: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org. **Required at least 3.1.0**.

## DBoW2, DBoW3 and g2o
Install `dbow2`, `dbow3`, and `g2o` through vcpkg. Place recognition supports
DBoW2 (default) or DBoW3 using the same ORB text vocabulary. Set `dbow_version: 3`
in YAML, pass `--dbow_version 3`, or select **DBoW version** in the viewer's
Tracking controls. Only values `2` and `3` are accepted; CLI overrides YAML.
See the [app guide](orbslam3_app/README.md#dbow-place-recognition) for runtime
switching and vocabulary-format details.

## Python
Required to calculate the alignment of the trajectory with the ground truth. **Required Numpy module**.

* (win) http://www.python.org/downloads/windows
* (deb) `sudo apt install libpython2.7-dev`
* (mac) preinstalled with osx

## ROS (optional)

We provide some examples to process input of a monocular, monocular-inertial, stereo, stereo-inertial or RGB-D camera using ROS. Building these examples is optional. These have been tested with ROS Melodic under Ubuntu 18.04.

# 3. Building ORB-SLAM3 library and examples

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3.git ORB_SLAM3
```

We provide a script `build.sh` to build the *Thirdparty* libraries and *ORB-SLAM3*. Please make sure you have installed all required dependencies (see section 2). Execute:
```
cd ORB_SLAM3
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

This will create **libORB_SLAM3.so**  at *lib* folder and the executables in *Examples* folder.

# 4. Running ORB-SLAM3 with your camera

Directory `Examples` contains several demo programs and calibration files to run ORB-SLAM3 in all sensor configurations with Intel Realsense cameras T265 and D435i. The steps needed to use your own camera are: 

1. Calibrate your camera following `Calibration_Tutorial.pdf` and write your calibration file `your_camera.yaml`
2. Modify one of the provided demos to suit your specific camera model, and build it
3. Connect the camera to your computer using USB3 or the appropriate interface
4. Run ORB-SLAM3. For example, for our D435i camera, we would execute:

```
./Examples/Stereo-Inertial/stereo_inertial_realsense_D435i Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt ./Examples/Stereo-Inertial/RealSense_D435i.yaml
```

## Feature Pipeline

Detection, description, and matching are independently selectable. Descriptors are computed by OpenCV, not a custom sampling implementation.

```yaml
keypoint_extractor:
  n_features: 1024
  scale_factor: 1.2
  n_levels: 8
  initial_threshold: 20
  minimum_threshold: 7
keypoint_detector:
  type: FAST
keypoint_descriptor:
  type: SIFT
descriptor_matcher:
  type: brute_force
```

- Detectors: `FAST`, `AGAST`, `GFTT`, `ORB`, `BRISK`, `SIFT`, `AKAZE` (case-insensitive).
- Descriptors: `ORB` (32-byte binary, default), `BRISK` (64-byte binary), `SIFT` (128 floating-point values). All supported descriptors can describe points from any supported detector. AKAZE descriptors are not offered because OpenCV requires AKAZE-specific scale-space metadata.
- Matchers: `brute_force` (default) or `flann`. Binary descriptors use Hamming distance and FLANN LSH; SIFT uses L2 distance and FLANN KD-trees. SLAM projection, pyramid-level, epipolar, ratio, and map-point checks remain in place around OpenCV candidate ranking.
- Exhaustive ranking inside geometric/vocabulary candidate sets uses OpenCV brute force even in FLANN mode: all candidates must remain available for subsequent geometric filtering, and an approximate index cannot reliably return every neighbor. Unconstrained nearest-neighbor searches use the selected backend.
- All detectors run across the feature pyramid with per-level spatial distribution. FAST/AGAST use the two configured corner thresholds; ORB/BRISK detectors use `initial_threshold`; the others use OpenCV defaults.
- The existing trained vocabulary still requires ORB descriptors. A separate, row-aligned OpenCV ORB channel is computed for vocabulary quantization only; tracking, stereo, triangulation, and map-point descriptors use the selected descriptor. This retains vocabulary-based loop closure and relocalization without feeding SIFT data into a binary vocabulary.
- Internal acceptance thresholds use 32-byte Hamming-equivalent units: BRISK Hamming distances are divided by two; SIFT L2 distances by four. Nearest-neighbor ratio tests are unchanged. Different descriptors can require accuracy tuning; descriptor selection is not a guarantee of equivalent trajectories.
- Saved atlases retain both descriptor channels. Older ORB atlases can be loaded; an atlas cannot be reused with a different tracking-descriptor format. New atlases require this version of the code.

Command-line selections override YAML:

```bash
.build/Release/orbslam3_app/orbslam3_app vocab/ORBvoc.txt config/TUM-VI.yaml \
  --slam-type stereo --keypoint_detector.type fast \
  --keypoint_descriptor.type sift --descriptor_matcher.type flann
```

The old `ORBextractor.*` and `orb_extractor.detector` settings have been replaced by the nested maps above. Project names, the upstream namespace/license notices, and ORB as an actual algorithm/vocabulary dependency are retained.

# 5. EuRoC Examples
[EuRoC dataset](http://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets) was recorded with two pinhole cameras and an inertial sensor. We provide an example script to launch EuRoC sequences in all the sensor configurations.

1. Download a sequence (ASL format) from http://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets

2. Open the script "euroc_examples.sh" in the root of the project. Change **pathDatasetEuroc** variable to point to the directory where the dataset has been uncompressed. 

3. Execute the following script to process all the sequences with all sensor configurations:
```
./euroc_examples
```

## Evaluation
EuRoC provides ground truth for each sequence in the IMU body reference. As pure visual executions report trajectories centered in the left camera, we provide in the "evaluation" folder the transformation of the ground truth to the left camera reference. Visual-inertial trajectories use the ground truth from the dataset.

Execute the following script to process sequences and compute the RMS ATE:
```
./euroc_eval_examples
```

# 6. TUM-VI Examples
[TUM-VI dataset](https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/visual-inertial-dataset) was recorded with two fisheye cameras and an inertial sensor.

1. Download a sequence from https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/visual-inertial-dataset and uncompress it.

2. Open the script "tum_vi_examples.sh" in the root of the project. Change **pathDatasetTUM_VI** variable to point to the directory where the dataset has been uncompressed. 

3. Execute the following script to process all the sequences with all sensor configurations:
```
./tum_vi_examples
```

## Evaluation
In TUM-VI ground truth is only available in the room where all sequences start and end. As a result the error measures the drift at the end of the sequence. 

Execute the following script to process sequences and compute the RMS ATE:
```
./tum_vi_eval_examples
```

# 7. ROS Examples

### Building the nodes for mono, mono-inertial, stereo, stereo-inertial and RGB-D
Tested with ROS Melodic and ubuntu 18.04.

1. Add the path including *Examples/ROS/ORB_SLAM3* to the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable. Open .bashrc file:
  ```
  gedit ~/.bashrc
  ```
and add at the end the following line. Replace PATH by the folder where you cloned ORB_SLAM3:

  ```
  export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=${ROS_PACKAGE_PATH}:PATH/ORB_SLAM3/Examples/ROS
  ```
  
2. Execute `build_ros.sh` script:

  ```
  chmod +x build_ros.sh
  ./build_ros.sh
  ```
  
### Running Monocular Node
For a monocular input from topic `/camera/image_raw` run node ORB_SLAM3/Mono. You will need to provide the vocabulary file and a settings file. See the monocular examples above.

  ```
  rosrun ORB_SLAM3 Mono PATH_TO_VOCABULARY PATH_TO_SETTINGS_FILE
  ```

### Running Monocular-Inertial Node
For a monocular input from topic `/camera/image_raw` and an inertial input from topic `/imu`, run node ORB_SLAM3/Mono_Inertial. Setting the optional third argument to true will apply CLAHE equalization to images (Mainly for TUM-VI dataset).

  ```
  rosrun ORB_SLAM3 Mono PATH_TO_VOCABULARY PATH_TO_SETTINGS_FILE [EQUALIZATION]	
  ```

### Running Stereo Node
For a stereo input from topic `/camera/left/image_raw` and `/camera/right/image_raw` run node ORB_SLAM3/Stereo. You will need to provide the vocabulary file and a settings file. For Pinhole camera model, if you **provide rectification matrices** (see Examples/Stereo/EuRoC.yaml example), the node will recitify the images online, **otherwise images must be pre-rectified**. For FishEye camera model, rectification is not required since system works with original images:

  ```
  rosrun ORB_SLAM3 Stereo PATH_TO_VOCABULARY PATH_TO_SETTINGS_FILE ONLINE_RECTIFICATION
  ```

### Running Stereo-Inertial Node
For a stereo input from topics `/camera/left/image_raw` and `/camera/right/image_raw`, and an inertial input from topic `/imu`, run node ORB_SLAM3/Stereo_Inertial. You will need to provide the vocabulary file and a settings file, including rectification matrices if required in a similar way to Stereo case:

  ```
  rosrun ORB_SLAM3 Stereo_Inertial PATH_TO_VOCABULARY PATH_TO_SETTINGS_FILE ONLINE_RECTIFICATION [EQUALIZATION]	
  ```
  
### Running RGB_D Node
For an RGB-D input from topics `/camera/rgb/image_raw` and `/camera/depth_registered/image_raw`, run node ORB_SLAM3/RGBD. You will need to provide the vocabulary file and a settings file. See the RGB-D example above.

  ```
  rosrun ORB_SLAM3 RGBD PATH_TO_VOCABULARY PATH_TO_SETTINGS_FILE
  ```

**Running ROS example:** Download a rosbag (e.g. V1_02_medium.bag) from the EuRoC dataset (http://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets). Open 3 tabs on the terminal and run the following command at each tab for a Stereo-Inertial configuration:
  ```
  roscore
  ```
  
  ```
  rosrun ORB_SLAM3 Stereo_Inertial Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt Examples/Stereo-Inertial/EuRoC.yaml true
  ```
  
  ```
  rosbag play --pause V1_02_medium.bag /cam0/image_raw:=/camera/left/image_raw /cam1/image_raw:=/camera/right/image_raw /imu0:=/imu
  ```
  
Once ORB-SLAM3 has loaded the vocabulary, press space in the rosbag tab.

**Remark:** For rosbags from TUM-VI dataset, some play issue may appear due to chunk size. One possible solution is to rebag them with the default chunk size, for example:
  ```
  rosrun rosbag fastrebag.py dataset-room1_512_16.bag dataset-room1_512_16_small_chunks.bag
  ```

# 9. Calibration
You can find a tutorial for visual-inertial calibration and a detailed description of the contents of valid configuration files at  `Calibration_Tutorial.pdf`

# `vcpkg`

```
./vcpkg install hello-imgui[glfw-binding,opengl3-binding]
./vcpkg install opencv[contib,nonfree,vtk]
```
